Camp Collab

The Final Project of the Event Handlers

Tired of planning your camping trip over countless emails and a shared spreadsheet? Team Camp Collab understands your pain. That's why we've created Camp Collab.

Camp Collab is a online application which allows you to create virtual campsites. Inside these sites, you can list all of the items required to make the trip a success. You and your invited guests can make claim to the items so that everyone brings their fair share. Your guests are NOT required to sign up.

The project is still in beta, but usable. Feel free to send us feedback @ teamcampcollab@gmail.com

Happy camping!
